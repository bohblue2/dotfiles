# Dotfiles
This repo contains everything to bootstrap my Macbook Air.

For various reasons, there are some things that need to be handled by hand rather than in a command script. Check out the `Manual Setup` section.

## Manual Setup
### Karabiner
1. Unzip the `(this repo)/zips/karabiner.zip` file under `~./config/`
2. all configuration files should exist under `~./config/karabiner`.
